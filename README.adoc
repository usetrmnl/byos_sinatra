*Local*

. Configure `BASE_URL` within `.env` to where your app is hosted (i.e. `http://192.168.x.x:4567`). ðŸ’¡ Lack of trailing slash is important.
. Run app in production mode: `ruby app.rb`.
. Retrieve your machine's local IP, ex 192.168.x.x (Mac: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'`)
. Confirm the application works by visiting `http://192.168.x.x:4567/devices` from any device also on the network.
. Point your [forked firmware](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware) `API_BASE_URL` ([source](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware/blob/2ee0723c66a3468b969c83d7663ffb3f8322ad99/include/config.h#L56)) to same value as `BASE_URL`.
