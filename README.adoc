Device.all

# Fetch upcoming render, sorts in descending order by created timestamp.
Images::Fetcher.new.call

# To generate default image.
Images::Creator.new.call "<p>Test.</p>"
#<Pathname:byos_sinatra/public/images/generated/81673687-28b0-4a0c-8efc-ebb344b63cf9.bmp>

# To generate image with custom path.
Images::Creator.new.call "<p>Test.</p>", Pathname.pwd.join("test.bmp")
#<Pathname:byos_sinatra/test.bmp>

# To generate image with custom path and dynamic name.
Images::Creator.new.call "<p>Test.</p>", Pathname.pwd.join("%<name>s.bmp")

== Deployement

*Local*

. Configure `APP_URL` within `.env` to where your app is hosted (i.e. `http://192.168.x.x:4567`). ðŸ’¡ Lack of trailing slash is important.
. Prefix `RACK_ENV=production` before launching the server to run in production mode.
. Retrieve your machine's local IP, ex 192.168.x.x (Mac: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'`)
. Confirm the application works by visiting `http://192.168.x.x:4567/devices` from any device also on the network.
. Point your [forked firmware](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware) `API_BASE_URL` ([source](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware/blob/2ee0723c66a3468b969c83d7663ffb3f8322ad99/include/config.h#L56)) to same value as `APP_URL`.
